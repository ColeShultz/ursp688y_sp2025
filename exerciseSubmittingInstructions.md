Here are all the detailed steps for getting your exercise from GitHub, then committing it back to GitHub and making a pull request to submit.

It looks complicated, and there are a few places where the details matter. But once you do it several times it will feel natural and make a lot more sense.

These instructions assume that you have already made a personal GitHub account and installed GitHub Desktop on your computer

#### Part 0: Fork the course repo at GitHub.com (only the first time)
0. Fork the [`ncsg/ursp688y_sp2025`](https://github.com/ncsg/ursp688y_sp2025) repo to your own account at GitHub.com.

#### Part 1: Clone your fork in GitHub Desktop (only the first time)
1. Go to File -> Clone Repository
2. Click on your fork of the repository in the GitHub.com list (`yourname/ursp688y_sp2025`)
3. Select "To contribute to the parent project" in the dialog about you're planning to use this fork.

#### Part 2: Edit and commit to your fork
4. Run Jupyter Lab in the directory where your fork is cloned
5. Add code, data, etc.
6. Commit each major change
7. 

#### Part 3: Make a pull request to the course repo

8. In your fork on the GitHub website, navigate to the root directory
9. `Sync fork` to make sure your file is the only difference between your fork and the course repo.
    - If prompted, DON'T click the red `Discard commits` button to delete the file you just added; click the green `Update branch` button to sync everything else that might have changed.
10. `Contribute` (to the left of `Sync Fork`), and `Open pull request`.
11. Make sure you are requesting a pull to the `ncsg/ursp688y_sp2024` base repository from your fork. Scroll through to make sure everything looks in order. There are probably one or two commits as part of your pull request, one to `Add files via upload`, and potentially a second to `Merge branch 'ncsg:main' into main`.
12. Click `Create pull request` at the top.
13. Add a short but meaningful title for your pull request (e.g., submitting exercise 1).
14. (optional) Add a description if there's something additional you'd like me (and others) to know about your submission.
15. Click `Create pull request` at the bottom.

#### ðŸ™Œ Congrats!
