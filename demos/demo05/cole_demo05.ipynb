    "\n",
    "APIs are an interface for accessing information. At the most general level, nearly all programs that can be accessed with code have an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python functions, for example, are programs with APIs. You access them by calling the function name and defining arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, when people talk about getting data from APIs they are usually talking about web APIs\n",
    "- These are usually designed with a software architecture called [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST).\n",
    "- Using a REST API involves making a request to a URL and receiving a response.\n",
    "- Often, that response is in a format called [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), which is structured like nested dictionaries and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to practice retrieving data about cities from web APIs, then wrangling the data they return into a tabular format we can analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making a request to an API is just another way to get data, similar to downloading it from an open data portal. Why would you bother querying an API instead of just downloading a table?\n",
    "- APIs allow programmatic access to data that can be easily scaled, replicated, and documented\n",
    "- APIs can allow customization of which data you are accessing\n",
    "- JSON allows for much more complex data structures than downloadable tables\n",
    "- APIs can be an easy way to access real-time data\n",
    "- Can we think of other reasons?"

    "- At the very least, do things consistently\n",
    "- One statement per line\n",
    "- Try to limit line length to 72 characters\n",
    "- Use four spaces to indent\n",
    "- Put spaces around operators (e.g., `1 + 1` or `day = 'Monday'`) (except in keyword function arguments)\n",
    "- Use blank lines intentionally and consistently\n",
    "- Use meaningful names\n",
    "- Name variables and functions with `lowercase_underscores`\n",
    "- Constants are often named in `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` (e.g., `C = 2.99792458e+8`)\n",
