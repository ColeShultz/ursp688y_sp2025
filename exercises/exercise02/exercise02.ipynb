    "## Problem\n",
    "A law passed in 2022 requires the District Court of Maryland to collect and distribute records of court filings for evictions. These data, *without* precise street addresses to protect tenant privacy, are available to download as a CSV table from the [Maryland Open Data Portal](https://opendata.maryland.gov/Housing/District-Court-of-Maryland-Eviction-Case-Data/mvqb-b4hf/about_data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The eviction process is complicated and produces messy data. Some fields in this table are structured with standard categories; others are not. Some eviction cases are documented by multiple \"events\" that sequentially record an initial filing and then a cancellation, eviction, or expiration (see the `Event Type` column). Other cases have multiple of the same type of event, or have only a single event. These may be recording errors, they may indicate that a case is outstanding, or that a follow-up event was simply never recorded. Unfortunatly, these types of internal inconsistencies are all too common in data about cities that are generated with imperfect, often manual systems, with little documentation about the definitions of columns or values, especially null values (I can't find a data dictionary or other official documentation for this table. Can you?). Data like these can also include entirely unstructured fields, such as `Event Comment`, which contain rich additional information but must be creatively parsed to use them.\n",

    "- First, write a function that takes the raw table as an inputâ€”-you can decide whether the argument to the function is a path to the CSV or a Pandas DataFrame into which you have already the CSV--and cleans it up into a tidy dataframe that is easy to use for this and future analyses. You can imagine using this function as a handy pre-processor whenever you download an updated copy of the eviction data.\n",
    "    - Consider changing the names of columns so they're intuitive and easy to access\n",
    "    - Consider changing the data types of columns so they are easy to sort and query (e.g., change dates stored as strings to Pandas datetimes, or change whole numbers stored as floats to integers).\n",

    "Below is a dictionary with a few hundred records of service requests from a dataset available on Montgomery County's [Open Data Portal](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Community-Recreation/Agency-Service-Requests/5diu-yj9e/about_data). I filtered the raw data to requests made so-far in 2025, did small amount of cleaning to exclude records with irregular structures, and stored the results in a dictionary so you can access it easily. In a couple weeks, we'll be working with more advanced tools and you'll be able to import the whole raw dataset as a table. For now, please just use this sample dictionary. Believe it or not, even huge raw datasets used widely by data scientists are often stored in dictionary-like formats, so it's a very common structure to work with. We'll see more about that in a few weeks, too.\n",
